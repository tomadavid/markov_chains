# markov_chains
Python class with utility functions for solving basic problems with Markov Chains.

The constructor receives a stochastic matrix that respresents the chain's transition model.

From there we can calculate:
- the probability of ocurring a transition with n steps between two states
- the probability of the chain being in each state after n transitions given an initial probability displacement
- the probability of the chain following a certain trajectory between states
